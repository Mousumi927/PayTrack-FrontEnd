Project Name: PayTrack

Problem:
Most banking apps lack features focused on children, such as parental control. Children often receive pocket money in cash or as gifts, leading to a lack of awareness about saving habits. Parents find it challenging to explain the importance of saving without proper tools. 

Solution: 
PayTrack is an innovative app that addresses these challenges. It consists of two essential components: the Child Phone side and the Parent Phone side.

On the Parent Phone side, alongside traditional banking features, there is a dedicated "Child" button. This feature empowers parents and relatives to send money directly to their child's bank account instead of giving cash. By digitizing pocket money and gifts, parents gain visibility into their child's transactions.

The Child Phone side of the app utilizes a gamified and rewarding approach to engage children and foster healthy saving habits. Kids can track their transactions, set savings goals, and earn rewards for reaching milestones. By visualizing the bigger picture of their savings, children learn financial responsibility and develop a habit of saving.

PayTrack redefines the way parents and children interact with money, bridging the gap between traditional banking and the financial needs of families. Our user-friendly interface and engaging features make financial education enjoyable for children and provide peace of mind for parents. Join PayTrack today and embark on a journey towards financial literacy and smart money management.
